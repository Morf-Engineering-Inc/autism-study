I’m reaching out to share an independent data analysis I’ve compiled that raises important and under-explored questions about autism, hormone disruption, and modern lifestyle exposures.
Over the last 50 years, autism rates have skyrocketed — as have global use of oral contraceptives, plastic packaging, and diet-related disease. Yet surprisingly, few studies have connected these parallel trends in a meaningful way.
I've attached a brief pitch that outlines a hypothesis connecting:
Endocrine-disrupting chemicals from plastics


Widespread synthetic hormone use (e.g. oral contraceptives)


Later maternal age and processed food-related health issues


This isn’t fringe speculation — the data is compelling, the biological mechanisms plausible, and the blind spot in research increasingly hard to ignore.
The full report includes visual comparisons of autism prevalence alongside plastic use, hormonal exposure trends, and maternal age shifts, with referenced citations from WHO, NIH, the Endocrine Society, and peer-reviewed journals.
Would you be open to reviewing the full analysis or speaking further about this story? I'm hoping to bring this conversation into the public sphere where it belongs — and your work aligns with the kind of thoughtful, science-forward journalism this topic deserves.
